    shortDescription: >
          An agnostic IoT platform which support all transmission protocols/ network types.
    longDescription: >
          *OS2iot removes that IoT-headache, you have over the technological side of your IoT-projects. 
          Gain an overview and more time to work on the results of the data.
          This solution is currently the only of its kind in Denmark. 
          It lets you register all your sensors (across technology and transmission type) and it leave you more time to choose your analyzing methods,
          so you get the most of your data.*
